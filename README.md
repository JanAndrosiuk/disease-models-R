Hereby we present network spread models developed in R. Models were done as the part of assignment for the Network Analysis course at Utrecht University. So far we present:
- Independent Cascade model 1: Stochastic model with constant probability of contagion and constant contagious period
- Independent Cascade model 2: Stochastic model with node-defined probability of contagion and assumption of being infectious till the end of simulation after being infected once.
- Threshold model: Deterministic model using fractional contagion thresholds instead of probabilities.

Specifics of each approach are described within respective scripts as comments.
